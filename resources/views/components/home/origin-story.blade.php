                    We've been running truck shops collectively for 20+ years. We know the frustration of clunky software that slows you down instead of helping you grow.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white/80 mb-6">
                    That's why we built ShopView - the software we wished existed when we were in your shoes. Every feature is designed by shop owners, for shop owners.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white/80">
                    ShopView made our shops more productive and efficient – and it will do the same for yours.
